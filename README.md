ESP32 Lightbulb with Matter Firmware
This is a sample firmware for an ESP32-based lightbulb that supports the Matter protocol. The code is written in C++ using the ESP-IDF framework.

Getting Started
To use this firmware, you will need an ESP32 development board and the necessary tools and development environment set up for ESP-IDF development.

Clone or download this repository.
Open the project in your preferred IDE or text editor.
Modify the firmware as needed for your specific use case. See the "Customization" section below for more information.
Build and flash the firmware to your ESP32 development board.
Power on the board and connect it to your Wi-Fi network.
The lightbulb should now be discoverable by any Matter-enabled device on the same network.
Customization
To customize the firmware for your specific use case, you will need to modify the code as needed. Here are some things you may want to change:

Wi-Fi credentials: In the app_main() function, you will need to modify the ssid and password fields of the wifi_config struct to match your Wi-Fi network's SSID and password.
MQTT broker URL: In the app_main() function, you will need to modify the uri field of the mqtt_cfg struct to match your MQTT broker's URL.
Matter endpoints: If you need to modify the endpoints for the Matter protocol (e.g. to use a different cloud service), you will need to modify the esp_matter_init() function call in the app_main() function.
Lightbulb behavior: You can modify the behavior of the lightbulb (e.g. turn it on or off) by modifying the mqtt_publish_task() function.
